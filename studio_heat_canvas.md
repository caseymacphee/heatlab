# Heat Pulse

## One-line intention
A calm, studio-native companion that tracks heated classes and helps users understand intensity and recovery over time — without coaching, templates, or content.

## Who it’s for
- People who attend **heated vinyasa / power / sculpt** classes at studios
- Students who already wear an Apple Watch and want a **purpose-built “hot room” session record**
- Studios that offer **cold plunge** as an optional post-class recovery step (secondary)

## Who it’s not for
- People looking for yoga instruction, routines, pose guidance, or at-home classes
- People wanting a hardcore contrast-therapy coaching app (protocols, rounds, “push harder” vibes)
- Medical monitoring or diagnostic use

## Core problem
Generic trackers record “Yoga” but don’t capture what makes heated classes different:
- Heat context (temp / “hot room” exposure)
- Recovery after a heat-stress session
- A simple personal baseline: “Was today harder than my usual for this temp?”

## Value proposition
- **Track the heated class as it is** (teacher leads; app stays out of the way - no time limites or segments, just start, stop, resume, end session)
- **Add the missing context** (heat level + class label)
- **Compare against “you,” not population norms** (baseline + trends)
- **Optionally log cold plunge recovery** when it’s part of the studio experience

## Differentiation
- “Heated class companion” instead of “timer” or “yoga content app”
- Watch-first, hands-free tracking intended for hot-room conditions
- Insight is framed as **personal trend + recovery**, not diagnosis or generic charts
- Cold plunge is positioned as **post-class recovery journaling**, not a full protocol coach

## Primary user journey
1) Start class (minimal interaction)
2) Stop class
3) Confirm heat context + optional class label
3.5) Resume or End
4) See a short summary + “vs your baseline”
5) Optionally log cold plunge
6) Review trends over weeks
7) See AI summary from foundation model

## Key features (v1)

### Tracking
- Start/stop a “Heated Class” session
- Automatic heart rate capture during class
- Post-class: quick pick for **heat level** (temp bucket)
- Optional class label: **heated vinyasa / power / sculpt**

### Summary
- Session recap (simple, readable) from AI on device
- “Compared to your usual at this heat level”: Typical / Higher / Lower effort
- Recovery indicator (simple and consistent)

### History + trends
- May want to collect user stats like 'age' and 'gender' to provide better heart rate results
- Session history list
- A small set of trends over time:
  - intensity vs baseline by heat level
  - recovery trend
  - acclimation signal (same heat feels easier over time)

### Cold plunge add-on (v2 non-mvp)
- “Add cold plunge” from the class summary
- Quick log: duration + optional temp bucket + “felt better?” check
- Over time: compare recovery on plunge vs non-plunge days (lightweight, non-causal language)

---

## Feature boundaries (explicit “no” list)
- No yoga instruction, pose prompts, class plans, or templates
- No in-class coaching or “do this now” guidance
- No social sharing, leaderboards, gamified streak pressure
- No medical claims, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations
- No required accounts/login for basic use

## Why this is worth paying for
Users pay for:
- A purpose-built heated class record (not buried inside generic “Yoga”)
- Fast, low-friction context capture (heat/class label)
- Clear “vs your baseline” summaries
- Trend visibility that supports habit + recovery decisions

## Monetization (simple)
- **One-time unlock** for “Unlimited history + trends + recovery comparisons”
- Optional later: additional paid “recovery pack” features (still not coaching)

---

## Success signals (what “working” looks like)
- Students reliably log ≥2 sessions/week
- Users open the post-class summary after most sessions
- Users can answer: “Was that harder than usual?” in 5 seconds
- Teacher/studio word-of-mouth: students recommend it to other students

## Key risks
- Becoming too generic (“just another workout tracker”)
- Sliding into instruction (templates/coaching) and losing studio trust
- Overpromising “insight” beyond what simple trends can support
- App Store positioning confusion if messaging isn’t crisp

## Strategic extension (later, optional)
A separate “Recovery Sessions” area for standalone sauna/cold protocols (for non-class days), kept visually and conceptually distinct to avoid a Frankenstein experience.
Ability to import activities there were created by garmin watches not just apple watches.
